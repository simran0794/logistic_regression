# logistic_regression
This repository contains an implementation of a Logistic Regression model, a fundamental algorithm in Machine Learning used for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression models the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class,making it a powerful tool for tasks such as spam detection, disease diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

Features
Binary Classification: Handles tasks where the output is one of two classes.

Sigmoid Function: Utilizes the sigmoid function to map predicted values to probabilities.

Regularization: Supports L1 and L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.

Data Visualization: Includes tools for visualizing decision boundaries and model performance.

Performance Metrics: Calculates key performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.
